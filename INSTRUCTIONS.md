# TRADE REPUBLIC: FRONTEND CODING TEST

Hi, thanks again for your application at Trade Republic. To proceed with the
interview process we have prepared a short coding exercise for you, to prove your
basic knowledge of the language and tools we use to develop our web applications.

In case you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your dedicated recruiter.

## Task: Fetch and display streaming market data

Developing our app, we work with a REST API as well as real-time streaming market
data to display the latest stock prices with millisecond latency. You should feel
comfortable developing an app to address these two types of network interaction.

For the coding test, you should create a Single Page App,
which should display the current price of a stock. The stock is identified via its ISIN.
The ISIN number is an international standardized identifier unique to a stock or
other financial instrument. The format is e.g. `DE000BASF111`.

Implement the following features for the sample SPA:

1. Connect to the web socket at `ws://159.89.15.214:8080/`. To receive
   continuous updates for a certain instrument, subscribe by sending a message in
   the the format `{"subscribe": "{isin}"}` to the websocket. You can choose
   any ISIN to connect, e.g. `{"subscribe": "DE000BASF111"}` will return updates
   for the BASF stock. You can unsubscribe by sending `{"unsubscribe": "{isin}"}`
   Please note: You will receive only sample data, the websocket is available 24/7.

2. You will receive live quotes from the web socket for the stock. The data format is
   `{"isin":"DE000BASF111","price":240.32,"bid":240.31,"ask":240.33}`. Display the
   latest price of any stock in an activity.

3. Implement a function to let the user either enter an ISIN themselves or
   choose from a list of predefined ISINs. When an ISIN is chosen, the application
   should subscribe to the updates and display the value of the selected stock. It should be
   possible to remove subscriptions from the list as well.

Please include the answers to the following in your README: 4. What happens in case the websocket disconnects? How would you go further to keep
the live data available or inform the user? Please discuss the challenges.

5. What happens if a user adds an instrument multiple times to their list? Please discuss
   possible challenges and mitigations. Please discuss possible challenges and mitigations.

## Things we care for:

- Unit tests
- Semantic HTML (Please donâ€™t use component libraries or styling frameworks like Material UI or Tailwind. While in practice these tools are useful, from the coding challenge we would like to see that you are comfortable without them.)
- Responsive Design
- Documentation
- Accessibility

## Nice to have:

- Use of Reactive programming libraries like RxJS

Please note: The coding test should show that you feel comfortable working with any JavaScript framework (we use vue.js and networking libraries, but you don't have to use vue.js for the coding challenge).

## Submit your solution

Please zip your project and submit zip archive via the Greenhouse link attached to the email with the code challenge. Your dedicated recruiter will receive the notification about your submission and will send it for the team review.
